# Angular Sandbox For State Management Series
`angular-sandbox-state-management-store-series`

## Overview

This **sandbox** app is used to build a state management store.  
We will be adding features (see repo branches) starting with very basic
state management needs and building to more advanced features.

### Tailwind CSS
This `sandbox` uses Tailwind CSS to help with styling.  We use Tailwind in most of our projects.  
It took us years to move to Tailwind (we were early Bootstrap enthusiasts) mainly because it 
went against our view of modular styling - i.e. where we define css classes and use those classes to ensure consistency. 
We still use classes but have moved away from global stylesheets to using components styled with Tailwind.  
The theming comes in how we configure Tailwind in each of our applications.
