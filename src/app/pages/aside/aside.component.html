<h1>Asides</h1>
<p class="text-xl">
  <code>Asides</code> are little snippets of learning included in this 
  app to demonstrate some of the Angular (and other) features we have 
  incorporated into this application.  It offers someone new to Angular
  a chance to learn more about the framework.  For those with more 
  experience, it is a good review and might even offer new 
  techniques.
